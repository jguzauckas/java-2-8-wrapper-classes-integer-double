# You Do

Make wrapper class variables for each of the following values:
- `15`
- `12.2`
- `-7`
- `-24.56`

Make primitive variables for each of the following values:
- `12`
- `3.45`
- `-4`
- `-1.23`

Using constants and the variables you just created, print out the following operations as equations (you should not be writing out any numbers or doing any of the math yourself):
- `15 + 3.45 = 18.45`
- `12.2 * 3.45 = 42.09`
- `-4 - -7 = 3`
- `-1.23 / -24.56 = 0.050081433225`
- `2147483647 * -7 = -2147483641`

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
